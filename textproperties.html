    <h1>Donkey</h1>
    <p>The donkey is a domesticated equine. It derives from the <a href="noway home">African</a> wild ass, Equus
        africanus, and may be classified
        either as a subspecies thereof, Equus africanus asinus, or as a separate species, Equus asinus.[1]: 1  It was
        domesticated in Africa some 5000–7000 years ago,[1]: 2 [2]: 3715 [3] and has been used mainly as a working
        animal since that time.</p>

    <p>There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used
        principally as draught or pack animals. While working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below
        subsistence, small numbers of donkeys or asses are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.</p>

    <h2>Why I Love Donkeys</h2>
    <p>Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is Equus asinus asinus, on the basis of the principle of
        priority used for scientific names of animals. However, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
        ruled in 2003 that if the domestic and the wild species are considered subspecies of a common species, the
        scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic
        subspecies</p>

    <p>At one time, the synonym ass was the more common term for the donkey. The first recorded use of donkey was in
        either 1784[9] or 1785.[10][11][12]: 239  While the word ass has cognates in most other Indo-European languages,
        donkey is an etymologically obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its
        derivation include the following:</p>

    <h3>Hope you enjoying the show</h3>
    <p>The genus Equus, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from Dinohippus, via the
        intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a
        donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to
        have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged Equus livenzovensis documented from western
        Europe and Russia.[1</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>By the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding centre had
        shifted to Mesopotamia by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made Damascus famous[citation
        needed], while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its
        easy gait. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in Arabia.</p>
