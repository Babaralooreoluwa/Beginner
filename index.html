    <h2>Common Chicken Knowledge</h2>
    <p>
        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
        India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a
        sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
        their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced
        in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

    <h3>More About Chickens</h3>
    <p>
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt
        in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria
        and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from
        the 5th century BC.[7][8
