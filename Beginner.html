            <h2>TERMINOLOGY</h2>
            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
            East
            Asia,<sup><a href="about.com">[3]</a></sup>
            but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
            subcontinent.
            From
            ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th
            century
            BC,
            with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
            according
            to
            the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]

            <h4>Medicine</h4>
            According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
            century as
            a
            euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used
            throughout
            North
            America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]
